# Hangman
A Ruby implementation of the game [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman)

This was created as part of The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization)

You get six guesses before it is game over. The game allows you to save your current game, and you are then able to load that saved game upon starting the program next time.

## Reflection
This project was created to practice manipulating files and serialization. I chose to serialize the game in the Marshal format as the information within the saved game doesn't need to be human readbale.
